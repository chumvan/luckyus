Imagine living in a small community near the San Miguel volcano in El Salvador. One day, heavy rains caused lahars to originate from the upper part of the volcano, causing damage and destruction to local communities. Then, on 11 April 2015, an explosion occurred resulting in ash plumes rising above the crater and drifting towards local communities, causing panic and fear. Living near such an active volcano would be incredibly challenging and difficult, where one never knows when the next eruption will occur. However, events like this remind us of how precious life is and how much we have to be thankful for. We can be grateful for our safety and for the people who work tirelessly to monitor and mitigate the effects of such natural disasters. It is important to appreciate the little things in life, to be thankful for what we have, and to make the most out of every day.
