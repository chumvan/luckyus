# Luckyus

A project to remind myself how lucky I am.
Dead simple:
    - Fetch data from NASA API about natural (disastrous) events
    - Enrich with scrapped data
    - Summarize
    - Philosophize by thinking and edit via GPT-API
    - post on a web-app

## TODO
    A lot
- persist data in a database
- containerize test deploy
